    "The decentralized loan feature allows you to borrow decentralized tokens by using your cryptocurrency holdings as collateral. To start, you must first create a vault and deposit collateral before you can take a loan.": "去中心化的貸款功能可讓您使用您擁有的加密貨幣持有量作為抵押品，並貸款去中心化的代幣。當您想啟動貸款功能，您必須先在鏈上創建一個金庫，並在貸款前存入抵押品。",
    "How is the collateralization ratio calculated?": "金庫抵押率是如何計算的？",
    "The collateralization ratio is calculated by taking the total collateral value deposited in a vault; divided by the amount of loan taken plus total interest, expressed in percentage.": "抵押率的計算方法是將存入金庫的抵押品總價值；除以貸款金額加上總利息，以百分比表示。",
    "What is the collateralization ratio used for?": "金庫抵押率的用途是什麼？",
    "The collateralization ratio determines the state of the vault. A ratio below the minimum collaterization ratio results in liquidation, upon which, a vault's collateral will be sent for auction.": "抵押率將決定金庫的狀態。比率低於最低抵押率會導致清算，此時，金庫的抵押品將直接送去拍賣。",
    "Indicators have been included to help visualise the health of your vault, where:": "顏色指示顯示出您的金庫目前的健康狀況，其中若是：",
    "Red: 1x – 1.25x above the minimum collateralization ratio": "紅色視為警告：目前處在最低抵押率的1.25倍~1.5倍",
    "Yellow: 1.25x – 1.5x the minimum collateralization ratio": "黃色視為注意： 目前處在最低抵押率的1.25倍~1.5倍",
    "Green: More than 1.5x the minimum collateralization ratio": "綠色視為正常：目前處在超過1.5倍的最低抵押率",
    "What do the different statuses of a vault mean?": "金庫的不同狀態是什麼意思？",
    "Empty: When a vault has been created but no collateral has been deposited yet.": "清空：當一個金庫已創建但尚未存入任何抵押品時。",
    "Ready: When collateral has been deposited into the vault, but no loan has been taken yet.": "準備就緒：當抵押品已存入金庫，但尚未獲得借貸時。",
    "Active (Red): When the collateralization ratio of a vault is between 1x – 1.25x the minimum collateralization ratio.": "活躍（紅色）：當金庫的抵押率在最低抵押率的 1 倍至 1.25 倍之間時。",
    "Active (Orange): When the collateralization ratio of a vault is between 1.25x – 1.5x the minimum collateralization ratio.": "活躍（橙色）：當金庫的抵押率在最低抵押率的 1.25 倍至 1.5 倍之間時。",

    "How are interests calculated for loan?": "貸款的利息是如何計算的？",
    "There are 2 types of interests that applies for loans, namely vault interest rate and token interest rate.": "貸款利息有兩種，分別為金庫利率和代幣利率",
    "The vault interest rate is determined when the vault owner selects the vault scheme, where the higher the minimum collateralization ratio, the lower the vault interest rate.": "金庫利率是在金庫所有者選擇金庫方案時確定的，最低抵押率越高，金庫利率越低。",
    "The token interest rate is applied on specific loan tokens, and can differ from token to token.": "代幣利率適用於特定的代幣貸款，不同的代幣會有不同的利率。",
    "The total interest rate applied on a loan is derived by taking the vault interest rate + token interest rate, and is calculated on a per annum basis.": "總利率是由：由金庫利率和代幣利率整體以每年率計算。",
    "What is collateral factor?": "抵押因素是什麼？",
    "The collateral factor determines the degree of contribution of each collateral token. For example, if a token is accepted at 70% collateral factor, $100 worth of the token would contribute to $70 of collateral value in a vault.": "抵押品因素決定每個抵押代幣的貢獻程度。例如，如果一個代幣以70%的抵押因素被接受，價值100美元的代幣將貢獻該金庫中70美元的抵押品價值。",
    "Why is there a 1% fee when paying DUSD loans with DFI?": "為什麼用 DFI 支付 DUSD 貸款要收取 1% 的費用？",
    "Per DFIP 2112-A, every DUSD loan will be payable with DFI as a way to overcome the DUSD premium currently seen on the DEX.\n\nWhen calculating how much equivalent DFI is to be paid for a DUSD loan, a 1% penalty fee is applied to the DFI/USD oracle value. To illustrate, if the DFI/USD oracle price is $10 today, how much a DFI is worth during a DUSD payment is calculated by taking $10 * (1 - 0.01), effectively reducing the value of DFI by 1% to $9.90 in such a scenario.": "根據 遞飛鏈改進提議 DFIP 2112-A，每筆 DUSD 貸款都將由 DFI 支付，以克服目前在 DEX 上 DUSD 溢價的情況。\n\n在計算用多少等值 DFI 作為支付 DUSD 貸款時，將會按照 預言機 上 DFI/USD 的價值收取 1% 的罰款。 以舉例來說，如果今天 DFI/USD 預言機價格是 10 美元，那麼用作支付 DUSD  期間， DFI 的相對價格計算方法 是 10 美元 * (1 - 0.01) 。在這情況下，DFI 的價值實際上減少了 1% 等於 9.90 美元。"

    "How is the minimum starting bid determined?": "最低起標價是基於什麼？",
    "The minimum starting bid is 105% of the batch's outstanding loan value. The additional 5% is included to cover the liquidation penalty, which is incurred upon vault liquidation.": "最低標價是批次未償貸款價值的105%。額外的5%是用來支付清算罰款的，這在金庫清算時是會產生的。",
