    "The decentralized loan feature allows you to borrow decentralized tokens by using your cryptocurrency holdings as collateral. To start, you must first create a vault and deposit collateral before you can take a loan.": "去中心化的贷款功能可让您使用您拥有的加密货币持有量作为抵押品，并贷款去中心化的代币。当您想启动贷款功能，您必须先在链上创建一个金库，并在贷款前存入抵押品。",
    "How is the collateralization ratio calculated?": "金库抵押率是如何计算的？",
    "The collateralization ratio is calculated by taking the total collateral value deposited in a vault; divided by the amount of loan taken plus total interest, expressed in percentage.": "抵押率的计算方法是将存入金库的抵押品总价值；除以贷款金额加上总利息，以百分比表示。",
    "What is the collateralization ratio used for?": "金库抵押率的用途是什么？",
    "The collateralization ratio determines the state of the vault. A ratio below the minimum collaterization ratio results in liquidation, upon which, a vault's collateral will be sent for auction.": "抵押率将决定金库的状态。比率低于最低抵押率会导致清算，此时，金库的抵押品将直接送去拍卖。",
    "Indicators have been included to help visualise the health of your vault, where:": "颜色指示显示出您的金库目前的健康状况，其中若是：",
    "Red: 1x – 1.25x above the minimum collateralization ratio": "红色视为警告：目前处在最低抵押率的1.25倍~1.5倍",
    "Yellow: 1.25x – 1.5x the minimum collateralization ratio": "黄色视为注意： 目前处在最低抵押率的1.25倍~1.5倍",
    "Green: More than 1.5x the minimum collateralization ratio": "绿色视为正常：目前处在超过1.5倍的最低抵押率",
    "What do the different statuses of a vault mean?": "金库的不同状态是什么意思？",
    "Empty: When a vault has been created but no collateral has been deposited yet.": "清空：当一个金库已创建但尚未存入任何抵押品时。",
    "Ready: When collateral has been deposited into the vault, but no loan has been taken yet.": "准备就绪：当抵押品已存入金库，但尚未获得借贷时。",
    "Active (Red): When the collateralization ratio of a vault is between 1x – 1.25x the minimum collateralization ratio.": "活跃（红色）：当金库的抵押率在最低抵押率的 1 倍至 1.25 倍之间时。",
    "Active (Orange): When the collateralization ratio of a vault is between 1.25x – 1.5x the minimum collateralization ratio.": "活跃（橙色）：当金库的抵押率在最低抵押率的 1.25 倍至 1.5 倍之间时。",
    "Active (Green):  When the collateralization ratio of a vault is more than 1.5x the minimum collateralization ratio.": "活跃（绿色）：当金库的抵押率超过最低抵押率的 1.5 倍时。",
    "In liquidation: When a vault's collateralization ratio falls below the minimum requirement.": "清算中：当金库的抵押率低于最低要求抵押率。",

    "How are interests calculated for loan?": "贷款的利息是如何计算的？",
    "There are 2 types of interests that applies for loans, namely vault interest rate and token interest rate.": "贷款利息有两种，分别为金库利率和代币利率",
    "The vault interest rate is determined when the vault owner selects the vault scheme, where the higher the minimum collateralization ratio, the lower the vault interest rate.": "金库利率是在金库所有者选择金库方案时确定的，最低抵押率越高，金库利率越低。",
    "The token interest rate is applied on specific loan tokens, and can differ from token to token.": "代币利率适用于特定的代币贷款，不同的代币会有不同的利率。",
    "The total interest rate applied on a loan is derived by taking the vault interest rate + token interest rate, and is calculated on a per annum basis.": "总利率是由：由金库利率和代币利率整体以每年率计算。",
    "What is collateral factor?": "抵押因素是什么？",
    "The collateral factor determines the degree of contribution of each collateral token. For example, if a token is accepted at 70% collateral factor, $100 worth of the token would contribute to $70 of collateral value in a vault.": "抵押品因素决定每个抵押代币的贡献程度。例如，如果一个代币以70%的抵押因素被接受，价值100美元的代币将贡献该金库中70美元的抵押品价值。",
    "Why is there a 1% fee when paying DUSD loans with DFI?": "為什麼用 DFI 支付 DUSD 貸款要收取 1% 的費用？",
    "Per DFIP 2112-A, every DUSD loan will be payable with DFI as a way to overcome the DUSD premium currently seen on the DEX.\n\nWhen calculating how much equivalent DFI is to be paid for a DUSD loan, a 1% penalty fee is applied to the DFI/USD oracle value. To illustrate, if the DFI/USD oracle price is $10 today, how much a DFI is worth during a DUSD payment is calculated by taking $10 * (1 - 0.01), effectively reducing the value of DFI by 1% to $9.90 in such a scenario.": "根据 递飞链改进提议 DFIP 2112-A，每笔 DUSD 贷款都将由 DFI 支付，以克服目前在 DEX 上 DUSD 溢价的情况。\n\n在计算用多少等值 DFI 作为支付 DUSD 贷款时，将会按照 预言机 上 DFI/USD 的价值收取 1% 的罚款。以举例来说，如果今天 DFI/USD 预言机价格是 10 美元，那么用作支付 DUSD  期间， DFI 的相对价格计算方法 是 10 美元 * (1 - 0.01) 。在这情况下，DFI 的价值实际上减少了 1% 等于 9.90 美元。"

    "How is the minimum starting bid determined?": "最低起标价是基于什么？",
    "The minimum starting bid is 105% of the batch's outstanding loan value. The additional 5% is included to cover the liquidation penalty, which is incurred upon vault liquidation.": "最低标价是批次未偿贷款价值的105%。额外的5%是用来支付清算罚款的，这在金库清算时是会产生的。",
