# ABI Source Explanation

**`/contracts`** directory contains the ABI (Application Binary Interface) for the "TransferDomainV1" smart contract. The ABI was generated based on the corresponding Solidity (.sol) file.

## Contract Information

- **Contract Name**: TransferDomainV1
- **Solidity File**: [TransferDomainV1.sol](https://github.com/DeFiCh/ain/blob/master/lib/ain-contracts/transfer_domain_v1/TransferDomainV1.sol)

## ABI Generation

The ABI provided in this repository was generated from the linked Solidity file. This ABI is essential for interacting with the TransferDomainV1 smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain or other compatible blockchains.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the ABI provided here is based on the linked Solidity file at the time of generation. Ensure that the Solidity code and the ABI are up-to-date and compatible with the version of the smart contract deployed on the blockchain you intend to interact with.

For any updates or changes to the contract, refer to the original source repository:
[TransferDomainV1.sol](https://github.com/DeFiCh/ain/blob/master/lib/ain-contracts/transfer_domain_v1/TransferDomainV1.sol)
